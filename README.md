# CPSC 224 Final Project: Eric Crandall Poker Face

### Project Description:

Poker with a southpark (and Dr. Crandall) theme.

For our version of the game, the tentative plan is to make a two player form of texas holdem. On the start screen,
players will be able to enter their names, get assigned an icon, select the number of starting chips/cash
they wish to have, or select the number of rounds the number of rounds they wish to play (by default this
will be as many rounds as it takes for one player to gain all the chips). A standard deck of 52 cards is used
and will be shuffled after each round of play.
